# CP1895-FlaskWebApplication
Advanced Python Programming Course Project - Flask Web Application
## Description
This flask application was created as a requisite for CP1895 Advanced Python Programming. This application will allow users to view, add and, delete recipes based on the user preference. To add a recipe the user must enter the recipe name, ingredients list, preparation instructions, and a corresponding image. The image is validated by checking the file extension. To delete a recipe, the user must select their choice from the dropdown and confirm their choice by clicking the 'Confirm Recipe' button. The View Recipes page shows each recipe name and image. To view the ingredients and prep instructions, the user can click on the corresponding button. The home page lists all recipe images as thumbnails which can be clicked to open the image in a new tab. The user is also able to register and login, each located on separated pages, and logout of an account. To navigate between pages, the user can click the desired link in the navigation bar located on each page.
